# Computational Cancer Researcher
A simple program counting SNPs and small indels

# Dependencies
You need Python 3 since this program uses vcfpy which is only available in Python 3.
``` bash
pip3 install vcfpy
pip3 install pysam
```

# How to use
Simply call the main.py using python module on your machine (mine is python3) and it will run on the sample .VCF file (project.NIST.hc.snps.indels.vcf)
``` bash
python3 main.py
```
